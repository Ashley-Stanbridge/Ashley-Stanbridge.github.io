    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>
     Grid based design is the process of using a grid  framework to structure a webpage with a set of rows and columns.

    <h3>What is all the hype about responsive web pages?</h3>
      <p>
     I suspect all the hype is a manifestation of hundreds of thousands of developers  now being able to (more) easily create desktop/tablet/mobile web pages with one process. Not only create but also maintain.

    <h3>Semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>
       Hmmm. This question is a little vague, but I think it's great. Or should I say, 
 div class="awesome".
