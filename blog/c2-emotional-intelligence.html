    <h3>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</h3> 
    <p>I really liked the analogy of the mind being like a flag and mindfulness being like the flagpole. the flagpole keeps the mind stable even when the flag is all over the place.</p> 
     
 
 
    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3> 
    <p>I am really intrigued by the section about converting emotions from existential to physiological. This is a very practical and beneficial piece of advice.</p> 
     
 
 
    <h3>How did you find the body scanning?</h3> 
    <p> it is very cool, I feel like I'm going to need a lot more practice though</p>
