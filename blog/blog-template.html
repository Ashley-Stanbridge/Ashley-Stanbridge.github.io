          <h3>Time Habbits</h3>
          <details>
            <summary>Read</summary>
             <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
   
                <p>
                In the past i have used the Fogg method. when i practicing tiny habits it was for almost exactly what he used as an example, for my health and fitness. 

                having watched his Ted talk i now see it would be a good idea to apply it much more broadly in more aspects of my life.
                </p>

                <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>

                <p>

                    I am pretty interested in timebox(ing?) in general. i thought that the pomoodoro technique is particularly interesting, or though i think 25 minutes is a little short for me.
                </p>

                <h3>What worked for you?</h3>

                <p>
                 Well i can’t say for sure as i have only just learned about the vast majority of these techniques, but knowing myself the way i do i suspect a health combination of mindful tiny habits is at the very least a logical start point.
                </p>

                <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>

                <p>
                I’m most interested in putting more time into and paying closer attention to the Fogg method.
                But i am also looking forward to becoming better with my mindful meditation.

        <h3>Design to web</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Read</summary>
         
                <h3>What a responcive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h3>

                <p>

                    Responsive webpage just means that it responds to a change in screen size and makes everything look nice no matter what you are viewing it on.
                    It's important as it mean you only need to create and mantain one website as opposed to many.
                </p>

                <h3>What mobile first design is and why it's important</h3>

                <p>
                  Mobile first design is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. it just mean that you build your website for mobile before you ajust for desktops.
                  it's important as the vast majority of people are useing there mobile the majority of the time.  
                </p>

                <h3>What are frameworks? and why do we use them?</h3>

                <p>
                    A framework in web devalopment is just like the framework of a house, it lays out the basic foundation of the page so you don't have to start every page from nothing.
                    they are increbible usefull as they save hours of unnessary work.
                </p>

                <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h3>

                <p>
                    Think of the wireframe like a draft of what a webpage is going to look like. it helps you stay on track while building the page and gives you an idea of how everything should sit on the page.<br> <img src="../wireframe.jpg" alt="a wireframe" height="150px" width="auto">
                </p>

                <h3>The aspects i found difficult</h3>

                <p>
                    My main problem was i was really intrested in having a push menu but wasn't able to use any javascript.
                    but i will implment it in the future.
                </p>

                <h3>The accessibility features i included</h3>

                <p>
                    This website uses the role feature to lable all major section of the page. all images also include a alt feature to tell screen readers what the image is
                </p>    

                <h3>The usability features i have used</h3>

                <p>This pasge uses a large navigation menu with well labled pages that can easly link back to the index page.
                    The colours have been chosen for there readability.

          <h3>T7 Javascript Basics</h3>
          <details>
            <summary>Read</summary>
             <h3>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
   
                <p>
                If we take my previous example of HTML being like the structure of a house and CSS being the furnishings, Javascript is like the people who live in and interact with the house.

                  It seems kind of illogical to compare them as they do completely different things. 
                  they are all essential to any well rounded webpage, it’s kind of like comparing water and air, both very different and both essential. 

                </p>

                <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>

                <p>
                Control flow is just the order different pieces of code are used in. For example when you need to go to work in the morning, you don’t just wake up and leave, there is a set of steps to follow. in Javascript that might look a little like this,  function getReadyForWork() {
                if (naked === true) { getDressed} else {go to the car} if (car.on = false) { start car} else (leave)}};.

                obviously you might get ready for work in a more comprehensive way then me, but the idea is still the same.


                loops are essentially the same only they process information over and over again until the have completed whatever they have set out to do. for example,  


                while (keys === lost) { 
                look for keys }   or   do { look for keys} while (keys === lost); .
              
                </p>

                <h3>The difference between accessing data from arrays andobject literals </h3>

                <p>
                 There are a number of ways you can store data with Javascript, so logically there is also a number of was to access that information. An array stores many separate blocks of information in a linear fashion. for example, var someCode = [“something1”, “something2”, “something3”].
                  as you can imagine this can be accessed by asking for it by number (keeping in mind computers count from zero) i.e someCode[2] would be “something3”.

                  you can also store information in objects, an object is literally like a box that holds all of the information. you can put things in the box like var things = { “name” : “Ashley”}
                   get things out of the box like this  console.log(things.name).
                </p>

                <h3>Waht are function? Why are they useful?</h3>

                <p>
                functions are just blocks of code you name and define. the are useful as they let you apply the same code in more then one place without having to write it over and over again.
                </p>

                <h3>What is the differences between functional and object oriented programming?</h3>

                <p>
                I have been reading about this all day and am  unfortunately still really unclear on what the distinction is. i will have to get back to you when i can give a full answer.
                </p>
