          <h3>Time Habbits</h3>
          <details>
            <summary>Read</summary>
             <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
   
                <p>
                In the past i have used the Fogg method. when i practicing tiny habits it was for almost exactly what he used as an example, for my health and fitness. 

                having watched his Ted talk i now see it would be a good idea to apply it much more broadly in more aspects of my life.
                </p>

                <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>

                <p>

                    I am pretty interested in timebox(ing?) in general. i thought that the pomoodoro technique is particularly interesting, or though i think 25 minutes is a little short for me.
                </p>

                <h3>What worked for you?</h3>

                <p>
                 Well i can’t say for sure as i have only just learned about the vast majority of these techniques, but knowing myself the way i do i suspect a health combination of mindful tiny habits is at the very least a logical start point.
                </p>

                <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>

                <p>
                I’m most interested in putting more time into and paying closer attention to the Fogg method.
                But i am also looking forward to becoming better with why mindful meditation.
