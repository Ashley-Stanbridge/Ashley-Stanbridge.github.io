          <h3>Time Habbits</h3>
          <details>
            <summary>Read</summary>
             <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
   
                <p>
                In the past i have used the Fogg method. when i practicing tiny habits it was for almost exactly what he used as an example, for my health and fitness. 

                having watched his Ted talk i now see it would be a good idea to apply it much more broadly in more aspects of my life.
                </p>

                <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>

                <p>

                    I am pretty interested in timebox(ing?) in general. i thought that the pomoodoro technique is particularly interesting, or though i think 25 minutes is a little short for me.
                </p>

                <h3>What worked for you?</h3>

                <p>
                 Well i can’t say for sure as i have only just learned about the vast majority of these techniques, but knowing myself the way i do i suspect a health combination of mindful tiny habits is at the very least a logical start point.
                </p>

                <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>

                <p>
                I’m most interested in putting more time into and paying closer attention to the Fogg method.
                But i am also looking forward to becoming better with why mindful meditation.

        <h3>Design to web</h3>
        <details>

                <h3>What a responcive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h3>

                <p>

                    Responsive webpage just means that it responds to a change in screen size and makes everything look nice no matter what you are viewing it on.
                    It's important as it mean you only need to create and mantain one website as opposed to many.
                </p>

                <h3>What mobile first design is and why it's important</h3>

                <p>
                  Mobile first design is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. it just mean that you build your website for mobile before you ajust for desktops.
                  it's important as the vast majority of people are useing there mobile the majority of the time.  
                </p>

                <h3>What are frameworks? and why do we use them?</h3>

                <p>
                    A framework in web devalopment is just like the framework of a house, it lays out the basic foundation of the page so you don't have to start every page from nothing.
                    they are increbible usefull as they save hours of unnessary work.
                </p>

                <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h3>

                <p>
                    Think of the wireframe like a draft of what a webpage is going to look like. it helps you stay on track while building the page and gives you an idea of how everything should sit on the page.<br> <img src="../wireframe.jpg" alt="a wireframe" height="150px" width="auto">
                </p>

                <h3>The aspects i found difficult</h3>

                <p>
                    My main problem was i was really intrested in having a push menu but wasn't able to use any javascript.
                    but i will implment it in the future.
                </p>

                <h3>The accessibility features i included</h3>

                <p>
                    This website uses the role feature to lable all major section of the page. all images also include a alt feature to tell screen readers what the image is
                </p>    

                <h3>The usability features i have used</h3>

                <p>This pasge uses a large navigation menu with well labled pages that can easly link back to the index page.
                    The colours have been chosen for there readability.
                </p>
