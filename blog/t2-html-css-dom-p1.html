    <h3>Features I Like</h3>
      <p>
      I am mostly interested in very minimal very user friendly design. 
      key features i admire are things like infinite scrolling, content that uses the full width of the page and simple animated drop down/ push menus.

    <h3>Analogy to describe HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
       As unoriginal as it may be, i think the best analogy to describe HTML and CSS is to think of the HTML as the frame of a house. where the rooms are, how many rooms there are etc. and the CSS is the style of the house, things like colour, the type of carpet, and art.

    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>
       Boxifying is pretty much just the process of thinking of your project or an existing website as a set of boxes that can fit together in a number of ways. 
      </p>

    <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>
      I think the box model is best described as box where you keep something important, like a jewelry box, only in this case the jewelry is content. because the content is really important we keep it in a box with loads of padding, a few margins and even a border. just to be sure.
