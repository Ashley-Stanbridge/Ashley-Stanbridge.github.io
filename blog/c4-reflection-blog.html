    <h3>What is your take on the EDA experience/What are your impressions?</h3>
    
    <p>
    I think the approach DBC and EDA have taken is a huge step in the right direction for a number of reasons.  (one of) The huge failing of the tertiary education system iHow do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?s the seemingly endless factory like process of changing a fortune to sit you in a room and talk at you for five years about abstract concepts relating to a field you may or may not be interested in. 

    The use of exams to demonstrate your knowledge of a subject is an unrealistic representation of the work force for 90% of subjects as it is a memory game, not a learning experience.

    EDA’s approach of teaching real world examples and simulating an actual work environment is not only more practical for training future developers  but is an actual leaning process where new knowledge can be demonstrated through, get this, actually developing something!

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
   
    <p>
I am very impressed. I spent a number of months trying to self teach myself to code leading up to the start of phase 0. or though there are many resources available online for leaning to code, i found that every one of them seems to assume you already have a certain level of knowledge.
there seemed to be no option for someone like me with zero understating of computer coding, but then, Phase 0 started and in only 3 weeks i have learned (not just memorised) more then i did in months of going it alone. so as far as i am concerned EDA is one of if not the best resources for learning to code that there is.

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>

    <p>
    my whole schooling life has been based in alternative learning environments having being homeschooled for a number of years before moving on to Discovery and the Unlimited. 
so without talking myself up in anyway, i think i am probably better prepared for the EDA experience then the vast majority of people.

 <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>

 <p>No, not really. As i’m sure you can imagine i did my research before using my embarrassingly small life saving to pay for this course.

I have several friends who graduated from EDA and spoke VERY highly of it. i also followed the blog pretty closely. and of course one of my former teachers now works for Enspiral and i’m willing to assume if he recognised it as somewhere worth working, then there is a very real chance i would as well.

<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>

<p>
Yes i am and no it does not.
