    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
   
    <p>
    In the past i have used the Fogg method. when i practicing tiny habits it was for almost exactly what he used as an example, for my health and fitness. 

    having watched his Ted talk i now see it would be a good idea to apply it much more broadly in more aspects of my life.

    <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>

    <p>

        I am pretty interested in timebox(ing?) in general. i thought that the pomoodoro technique is particularly interesting, or though i think 25 minutes is a little short for me.
    </p>

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>

    <p>
     Well i can’t say for sure as i have only just learned about the vast majority of these techniques, but knowing myself the way i do i suspect a health combination of mindful tiny habits is at the very least a logical start point.
    </p>

    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>

    <p>
    I’m most interested in putting more time into and paying closer attention to the Fogg method.
    But i am also looking forward to becoming better with why mindful meditation.
